This script accepts the history of a pycharm console session, an objective, and the line in which that objective was
achieved as input, and returns a report in the form of a jupyter notebook, using google's gemini AI API.

This script can be a useful tool to rapidly create a usable script once a theoretical problem has been solved in the
console. This is an optimal use of a large language model because it involves processing a large amount of text and returning a
some of it in a systematic way.

This project has helped me gain experience in engineering prompts to get the most out of generative AI, and made me
curious to continue learning about the interplay between code and natural language.
